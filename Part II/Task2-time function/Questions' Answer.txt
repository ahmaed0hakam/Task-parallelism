1. What is the exact execution time?

Answer:
	for task 1 with threads it's 1857900
	for task 1 without threads it's 552700

2. Is there any difference? Why?

Answer: 
	In task 1, it takes execution time with threads more than the case without threads.
	creating a thread is a relatively expensive OS operation, and context switching is a relatively expensive operation too.
	We will be waiting the first 4 threads to finish their works, then the fifth thread will start working, and we will be waiting again until it finishes its work.
	So, time will be like (the sequential solution time+ creating threads time).
