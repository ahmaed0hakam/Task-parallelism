1. What is the exact execution time?

Answer:
	for task 1 with threads it's 4323600
	for task 1 without threads it's 1716001
	for task 2 with threads it's 1549900
	for task 2 without threads it's 6099671100

2. Is there any difference? Why?

Answer: 
	In task 1, it takes execution time with threads more than the case without threads.
	creating a thread is a relatively expensive OS operation, and context switching is again a relatively expensive operation.
	We will be waiting for every thread to finish its work, so the time will be like (the sequential solution time+ creating threads time).

	In task 2, it takes execution time without threads more than the case with threads.
	I just made an one thread, so there is not much context switching time, and there is I/O operations, which is a case that multithreading can be more useful with.
